# Postmortem of University of Washington CSE Sexism and Bullying Investigation

For the last 6 months, the University of Washington Allen School has
been investigating the toxic and sexist environment in the systems and
networking labs that caused four women to leave UW -- two went to
industry jobs and two have gone to other departments -- and four other
women to lose at least one year of their PhDs. Despite this impact, no
one has faced consequences or repercussions.

Instead, the university has chosen to blame me for the situation,
gaslight the women, and fail in their duty to provide a safe learning
environment.  This outcome is not surprising as it is a common one in
these situations (see: DARVO). What is surprising is how many
opportunities there were for the Allen School administration to
de-escalate the problem for the mutual benefit of the women and the
school, but instead let the men manipulate them and use the system to
further harass the women.

The situation culminated recently in an [HR
report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QqE1Lk9RAWa4MLeHSirsWd7MAbxfl7pz/view).
The subjects of the report are three men; these three men were not the
only contributors to the sexist lab culture; however, they forced the
HR investigation by refusing to let the faculty institute a code of
conduct for the lab and reporting to the university's civil rights
office.

## Background
For the past few years, there has been ongoing harassment of women
from a small number of men in the UW systems and networking lab, which
is detailed in this timeline.  I became involved last July when one of
the harassers was following the women around at OSDI and making them
uncomfortable.  The week before that, one of the women from the lab
had also told me that some harassment was happening in the lab and
asked for my advice on how to handle it.

At the urging of the Allen School grad counselors, the women produced
a letter detailing three example incidents pulled from their timeline.
This letter was given to Magda Balazinska, the director of the Allen
School, who then passed it on without the women's consent to "the
Dean's office as well as to the appropriate investigating offices at
the UW (Title IX, Student Conduct, and Human Resources)."
 
As these offices are very much for protecting the university and not
the students, I resigned my affiliation with the Allen School due to
their refusal to do anything for the women, other than pass their
letter on to university offices.

## My experience

My initial attempt was to mediate between the faculty and the
students.  My primary goal was to protect the women and help them
repair their relationships with their advisors, so I would not have to
continue mediation.  The women have written a 

After the HR investigation started, the faculty and students were
instructed not to speak about the situation. Thus, I became the only
person that could support the women and speak out. Due to more facts
that came to light about incidents of physical violence, I felt
obligated to report to the broader CS community on the environment at
UW. 



## HR Investigation Subjects

The three men that were the subject of the UW HR investigation are:
Pratyush Patel, Tapan Chugh and Anish Nyayachavadi. I've chosen the
name the men here for a few reasons: 1) there are so few women that
they are easily identifiable in the HR report, 2) there are a large
number of other men in the lab that were not involved, 3) these men
chose to involve themselves in the investigation by filing complaints
against the women and the faculty.

These three men became the subj
One of the things that caused the investigation in the first place is
that Pratyush, Tapan and Anish objected to the faculty members putting
in place a code of conduct *in their own labs*. The proposed code of
conduct was derived from the industry standard [Contributor's Covenent](
https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), which is used in a modified
form on every Microsoft open source project. 




## Outcome

While the report finds that none of the incidents involving the three
men rise to the level of "harassment" by a narrow legal definition, it
would be difficult to imagine that the incidents described would be
allowed at any company. For example, several of the incidents detailed
in the report are explicitly banned by Microsoft's sexual harassment
policy. 


Anish further escalated the situation by filing a CRIO complaint;
however, as he is not a member of a protected class, CRIO did not
accept his
