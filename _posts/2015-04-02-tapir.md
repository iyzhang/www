title: Lessons learned from TAPIR(s)
---

Having just finished yet another iteration of the TAPIR paper, I
thought I would try to distill what I have learned from the project.

### 1. Replication protocols should be co-designed with the systems that use them, *not* applications.

Applications do not commonly use replication protocols directly today;
instead, they are usually packaged into a fault-tolerant service or
storage system.  As Mike Burrows notes [1], there are a lot of reasons
to put Paxos into a lock server and present it as a service, rather
than package it as a library.  With this in mind, we should be
designing replication protocols for distributed systems, not
applications.

Unfortunately, many high-performance replication protocols are
designed for applications, so are often not super useful for
distributed systems. For example, eventual consistency protocols
expect the application to resolve conflicts after they happen, but a
storage system using the protocol has no idea how to resolve a
conflict in data from an application (i.e., Dynamo [2] cannot resolve
a conflict in the shopping cart). Protocols for commutative
operations, like Generalized Paxos [3] and EPaxos [4], have a similar
problem (i.e., they do not know which application operations commute).

<!---
Optimized replication protocols are often not super useful for
distributed systems.  For example, protocols , only work if
the the storage system *and* application have commutative
operations. This means that system designer has to carefully design
for commutativity and then count on the application programmer to do
the same; even then, a large set of systems and application operations
just do not commute. Eventual consistency protocols have a similar
problem: they expect the application to resolve conflicts after they
happen, but a storage system has no idea how to resolve a conflict in
data handed to them by *their* application.
For example, Dynamo [2]
has to rely on Amazon's shopping cart application to resolve conflicts
because it does not know how to do so in a general-purpose way.

### 2. Paxos is too strict (and expensive) for a lot of systems.

Today, systems that want to provide strong guarantees use Paxos \[6\]
(or, if you are hipper than me, RAFT [7]), and everyone else uses
something cheaper.  Paxos enforces a strict serial ordering of
operations across replicas, which is useful, but requires coordination
across replicas on *every* operation, which is expensive.

What we found in the TAPIR project is that Paxos is *too* strong for
some strong system guarantees and, as a result, is wasting work and
performance for those systems.  For example, a lock server wants
*mutual exclusion*, but Paxos provides a strict serial ordering of
lock operations. This means that a lock server built using Paxos for
replication is coordinating across replicas even when it is not
necessary to ensure mutual exclusion.

Even more interesting, a transactional storage system wants strictly
serializable transactions, which requires a linearizable ordering of
transaction but only requires a *partial* ordering of operations
(because not all transactions touch all keys).  With some careful
design in TAPIR, we are able to enforce a linearizable ordering of
transactions with *no* ordering of operations.


### 3. We can still provide the same strong guarantees to applications without consistency!

At the core of the TAPIR project is a new replication protocol, which
we call *inconsistent replication* or IR, that provides
fault-tolerance but no consistency.  IR is well-designed to provide
high-performance replication for a class of system guarantees,
including mutual exclusion and ACID with linearizable transaction
ordering.  Instead of an ordered operation log, IR provides an
*unordered operation set*.  Without ordering, IR is able process
operations without a leader or any synchronous cross-replica
coordination, similar to eventual consistency protocols.

But, unlike eventual consistency, IR allows distributed systems to
*avoid* conflicts before they happen, rather than resolving them after
they happen. This allows systems retain strong guarantees for their
applications and hide any inconsistencies from application
programmers. IR's limitation is that it can only support system
guarantees that are pair-wise.  For example, we can build a lock
server that provides mutual exclusion but not a store that only sells
thing that are in stock because calculating the store's stock requires
a full history of operations that only strong consistency can achieve.

### 4. Good clock synchronization is available and we should use it.

Without ordering in the replication layer, TAPIR needs another way to
efficiently order transactions, so it uses loosely synchronized clocks
for better performance.  Throughout the project, we have continuously been
surprised by how good clock synchronization is on various
platforms. In fact, we designed several extensions to TAPIR to cope
with clock skew but never had to pull them out.

When we first started testing on our local cluster using PTP [8],
which is available as a Linux package and does not require any special
hardware, the clock synchronization was so good that it broke our
random number generator because we were seeding it with the clock!  As
others [2] have noticed, PTP is able to offer at least sub-microsecond
synchronization without any special support. When we moved to
wide-area experiments using Google Compute Engine [3], we found clocks
skews within milliseconds, even though we were using virtual machines
over the wide-area.

Engine testbed.

### 5. Tapirs are cute and baby tapirs are really cute.

We have experimentally verified that tapirs are adorable. By looking
at countless photos of baby tapirs in real-world conditions, we have
measured 100% of baby tapirs to be extremely cute.

### Summary

We should design better replication protocols optimized for
distributed systems, not applications. For a class of strong system
guarantees, Paxos is too strong and eventual consistency is too
weak. Instead, we have designed inconsistent replication, a new
replication protocol that provides fault-tolerance without consistency
for distributed systems. Using IR and loosely synchronized clocks,
TAPIR is able to provide high-performance distributed transactions. To
