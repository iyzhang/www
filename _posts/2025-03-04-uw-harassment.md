# My Experience with the University of Washington CSE Sexual
  Harassment and Bullying Investigation

For the last 6 months, the [UW Allen School of
CSE](https://www.cs.washington.edu) has been investigating the toxic
and sexist environment in the systems and networking labs that caused
four women to leave UW -- two went to industry jobs and two have gone
to other departments -- and four other women to lose at least one year
of their PhDs. Despite this impact, no one has faced consequences or
repercussions.

Instead, the university has chosen to blame me for the situation,
gaslight the women, and fail to provide a safe learning environment
for female PhD students.  This outcome is not surprising (see:
[DARVO](); what is surprising is how many times the Allen School
administration could have de-escalated the situation for the mutual
benefit of the women and the school but instead let the men manipulate
them and use the system to further harass the women. The remainder of
this post is about my personal experience with the situation (usual
disclaimers apply).

I'd like to thank my management chain at MSR for being supportive
while I was involved in this situation. Generally, Microsoft seemed to
take the stance that working with students is part of my job, and I
should be able to do my job without experiencing inappropriate
behavior.  As a result, they also took it very seriously when my
husband received threatening emails about the situation. I expect to
get some more after this blog post.

## Overview

On July 12, 2024, seven women sent a letter to the systems and
networking faculty (Tom, Baris, Simon, Ratul and Arvind) detailing
three harassment incidents and asking for, among other things, a lab
code of conduct and sexual harassment training.  They wrote this
letter at the request of the grad counselors, after the men had
reported them repeatedly to the advisors for making the lab an
"unwelcoming" space by talking about "women's issues" including
women's access to medical care.

UW hired outside legal counsel to conduct a 6 month investigation,
which resulted in this [publicly available
report.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QqE1Lk9RAWa4MLeHSirsWd7MAbxfl7pz/view).
While the report finds that none of the incidents involving the three
men rise to the level of "harassment" by a narrow legal definition, it
would be difficult to imagine that the incidents described would be
allowed at any company. For example, several of the incidents detailed
in the report are explicitly banned by Microsoft's sexual harassment
policy.

Almost 9 months after sending their letter to the advisors, most of
the women have still not rejoined their labs or returned to lab
activities.  The Allen School is now finally working on sexual
harassment training and a code of conduct.


## My Experience

I became involved in the situation around the time of OSDI 2024
because the harassers were following the women around the
conference. I only became involved because:

1. The situation did not seem serious enough to require much of my
time. It was inexplicable to me why the advisors were tolerating the
kind of behavior discussed in the report.

2. I personally knew many of the faculty. I have known Simon, who
advises one of the men, since 2008 and I have known Baris since 2020
when I chaired EuroDW with him. I've also known and worked with Tom
since 2012.

3. The women had already attempted to talk to the faculty for months
and even asked another female faculty member to talk to the faculty in
the lab (as there were no women faculty in systems or networking at
the time).

The seven women that wrote the July 12 letter clearly had no effective
advocate among the faculty, and I was worried more of them would drop
out.  My primary goal was to protect the women from further harm and
de-escalate the situation, while repairing the relationship between
the women and their advisors.

After the HR investigation started, the faculty and students were
instructed not to speak about the situation. Thus, I became the only
person that could support the women and speak out.  I only chose to
speak publicly when:

1. I was forced to explain the situation and support a new woman
joining the lab.  No one at UW explained to her why there were no
women in the systems lab or that it might be unsafe for her to be
around the men under investigation.

2. I heard another credible report of harassment from the same men of
a woman in another lab. I also learned about more incidents of
physical violence (which are detailed in the report).
 
3. Magda (the school director) refused to implement any changes unless
the women made a formal complaint to Title IX.  As the harm
perpatrated by university Title IX offices is well documented (and the
women sent an email with the research on that to the administration),
I expected this would be a traumatic experience and not achieve my
goal of making sure the women could rejoin their lab.

Until these things happened, I had thought the issues were limited to
the systems lab and would be fixed quickly, but it became clear to me
that the issues were more severe and pervasive than I thought, so I
posted to Twitter, Facebook and Mastodon, as well as, sending my
resignation via the uw-systems mailing list.

## HR Investigation Subjects

No one has instructed me not to share the men's names, so the three
men that were the subject of the UW HR investigation are: Pratyush
Patel (Iota), Tapan Chugh (Theta) and Anish Nyayachavadi (Eta).  Per
the report, most of the bullying came from Anish, while Tapan is
physically violent, and Pratyush was emotionally abusing and stealing
ideas and work from women.  Since many of the events in the report did
not happen on campus or between "friends", they were not counted as
harassment.  There are more details and evidence (e.g., slack
messages, emails, text messages) from the women in the report.

I feel that it is important for me to disclose the men's identity
because, while the women are easily identifiable by details in the
report, the men are not because there are vastly more men than women
in the lab. Furthermore, as the men will continue to be in our
communities without consequences, I do not want women who are not
privileged enough to be part of the whisper network to suffer
harassment from them.

I also stress that their behavior was enabled by their advisors,
especially Ratul Mahajan (Omicron) who advises all of the men.  Again,
I want to ensure that all women can make informed descisions about
grad school and advisors and not just those who have the privilege of
knowing who is problematic and who is not.  It is clear even now that
the advisors prioritize the men's careers over the women that left,
and over the mental health and careers of the women that remain.

## Future Lessons

If you experience a similar situation in your department, do not make
the same mistakes as the Allen School.  While by no means
comprehensive, some easy things for other CS departments to do:

1. Make expectations of appropriate behavior clear. If inappropriate
behavior pops up, deal with it swiftly and aggressively.

2. Expect harassment when advising women. Statistically, any woman in
grad school will experience some form of harassment; be prepared to
spot it and help deal with it.

3. Be aware (if you are not already), that university processes
protect the university and not marginalized students.  If at all
possible, resolve the situation without university administration
involvement.

It basically boils down to this: do not recruit women and other URM to
your lab if you have no plan for how to keep them safe. There are
plenty of experts and researchers who study these things (e.g., Nicole
Bedera), read their books and educate yourself before it's too late.
