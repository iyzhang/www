How I (almost) deployed Demikernel at Microsoft and what's next

For the last 3 years, I have been working with the Bing organization
to move their BondRPC stack to Demikernel. It has been a challenging
road that ultimately failed because the systems that drive search no
longer require microsecond tail latencies. I considered writing this
blog post for a long time but haven't because I've been spending a lot
of time thinking of the broader implications for systems researchers
of this failed deployment.
