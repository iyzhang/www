### DEI

During the 2024-2025 school year, I supported a group of 8 women from
the University of Washington Allen School who were being sexually
harassed and bullied in the systems and networking lab. This
experience prompted me to write two blog posts:

* An analysis on [the moral implications of being a successful computer scientist and a woman](_posts/2024-07-24-misogyny.md).
* A [post-mortem summary, which
provides recommendations for how to avoid these situations in your own
lab](_posts/2025-03-04-uw-harassment.md).

I have worked on combatting harassment at CS conferences.  I, along
with folks at Microsoft Research, [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community)
and the [Superhero
Network](https://github.com/iyzhang/superhero-network) have designed
the [CS Climate Survey](https://www.csclimatesurvey.org), a
measurement study of harassment and discrimination at CS conferences.
We hope to eventually standardize codes of conduct across conferences
and ensure conference safety.

During my PhD, I started Women's Research Day at UW as a day of
technical content presented by women for women. Now renamed Diverse
Genders Day, it has been running for more than a decade!
