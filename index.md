## I am a principal researcher at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/).

I am especially interested in making it easier to build
microsecond-scale datacenter systems by leveraging new datacenter
hardware technologies, like kernel-bypass, RDMA and programmable
devices.  My most recent work has been on the [Demikernel datapath
OS](//github.com/microsoft/demikernel) and related projects.  A
[bio](/files/bio.txt) and <a href="abstract.txt">talk abstract</a> for
my most recent work is available.

I completed my PhD in 2017 at the [University of
Washington](//www.cs.washington.edu), where my research focused on
distributed systems that span mobile devices and cloud servers.  My
thesis work received the ACM SIGOPS Dennis Ritchie doctoral
dissertation award and the UW Allen School William Chan doctoral
dissertion award.  Before my PhD, I received my S.B. and M.Eng.  from
[MIT](http://www.mit.edu) and worked for 3 years in the
virtual machine monitor group at <a
href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>.
  
I was born in <a href="http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/">Beijing, China</a>
but spent most of my time growing up
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Indiana">Columbus,
Indiana</a>. <a href="http://www.drkp.net">My husband</a> and I like
to cook, travel and occasionally do computer science together.
