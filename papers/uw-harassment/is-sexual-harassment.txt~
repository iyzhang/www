Sexual harassment doesn't have to meet a legal standard to be
considered unacceptable. Even if the findings of the official
investigation didn't conclude that university policies were violated,
the descriptions in these documents are consistent with behaviors that
could reasonably be defined as sexual harassment for the following reasons:

1. Hostile Environment:
* The reports indicate a pattern of sexist, misogynistic, and
derogatory comments directed towards female students, which has
contributed to a hostile work environment.
* Examples include Anish’s gender-based insults, unwanted comments about women’s roles, and jokes with inappropriate sexual overtones.
* The sharing of vulgar content (like sexist song lyrics) and jokes aimed at provoking discomfort is also a form of harassment.

2. Unwanted Advances:
* Xiao's inappropriate Slack messages to Maddie, including commenting on her appearance, followed by deleting and replacing them, constitutes sexual harassment, especially since it was unsolicited and made her uncomfortable.

3. Retaliatory Behavior:
* If individuals like Anish and Pratyush are engaging in retaliation against those who speak out about their behavior, this is another form of harassment.
* The attempt to discredit female students by spreading misleading narratives about them is also concerning.

4. Non-Consensual Contact:
* Tapan putting his hand on a female student's neck without consent is a clear violation of personal boundaries and could be considered sexual harassment or even assault, depending on the circumstances.

5. Gender Discrimination:
* The unequal distribution of menial tasks (ordering food, cleaning, etc.) primarily falling on female students further demonstrates a pattern of gender-based discrimination.

6. Creating a Fearful Environment:
* Advising women to avoid the lab for their own safety indicates that the environment has become threatening enough to warrant concern about their well-being.
