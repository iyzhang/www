## Overview
The report, dated January 27, 2025, was prepared by Katherine F. Weber from Inslee, Best, Doezie & Ryder for the University of Washington, Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. It was initiated to investigate workplace concerns within the Systems Lab (SysLab) related to allegations of sexism, misogyny, gender harassment, and inappropriate conduct.

## Scope of Investigation

The investigation was initiated after the “Women of SysLab” sent an undated letter (around July 12, 2024) to the SysLab Faculty outlining various concerns, including:

* Inappropriate romantic gestures.
* Aggressive and intimidating behavior by a male postdoc towards a female student.
* Harmful, sexist comments from another male student.
* General references to gender harassment, sexism, and a "background noise of misogyny."
* Dissatisfaction with the response from certain faculty members.

The women also provided a detailed timeline of events spanning back to 2022.
A formal complaint was also made by one of the male students (Mr. Eta) alleging harassment based on gender, religion, national origin, and retaliation.
A total of 33 participants were interviewed, mostly current or former SysLab student-employees, along with postdocs, faculty, and staff.

Retaliation from faculty and female students.
Key Events & Incidents:
Background (2022-2023):
SysLab was described as a collaborative, inclusive environment until the 2023-2024 school year.
Increased student population (35 total, with 7 female and 28 male) led to a shift in dynamics.
2023-2024 School Year:
Uncomfortable Interactions with Mr. Eta:
Multiple instances of inappropriate comments and behavior, including sexist jokes, off-putting comments, and insensitive remarks about depression.
Text messages sent to Ms. Alpha containing sexist and vulgar content (e.g., song lyrics, insensitive jokes).
February 11, 2024: Kanye West/Taylor Swift Incident:
Heated argument between Mr. Eta and other students over Kanye West’s behavior towards Taylor Swift at the VMAs, leading to Mr. Eta feeling attacked and targeted.
Follow-up conversations attempted to resolve misunderstandings but escalated tensions.
Post-Incident Developments:
Mr. Eta expressed concerns about his reputation being damaged and felt ostracized.
Faculty involvement (Prof. Omicron, Prof. Nu, and others) attempted to mediate but often exacerbated issues.
Advice was given to Mr. Eta to try to clear the air with his peers, but efforts were unsuccessful.
Findings & Conclusions:
Investigation Outcome:
The investigation found no violations of the University's policies (Executive Order No. 31) or applicable federal and state laws.
The allegations did not meet the threshold for unlawful harassment or discrimination.
However, issues were noted regarding:
Poor professionalism.
Lack of equity, inclusion, and belonging within SysLab.
The report encouraged the School to consider these issues moving forward.
