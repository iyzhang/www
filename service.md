### Outreach
I'm currently working on a new initiative to combat harassment at CS
conferences.  The Superhero Network is an unaffiliated group of mid-career women
that are experts and advocates in harassment prevention and
intervention.  We are currently working on standardizing codes of
conduct across conferences and ensuring conference safety.

I started Women's Research Day at UW as a day of technical content
presented by women for women. It is now in its sixth year!
