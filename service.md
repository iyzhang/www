### Outreach

I have worked on combatting harassment at CS conferences.  I, along
with folks at Microsoft Research, [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community)
and the [Superhero
Network](https://github.com/iyzhang/superhero-network) have designed
the [CS Climate Survey](https://www.csclimatesurvey.org), a
measurement study of harassment and discrimination at CS conferences.
We hope to eventually standardize codes of conduct across conferences
and ensure conference safety.

During my PhD, I started Women's Research Day at UW as a day of
technical content presented by women for women. Now renamed Diverse
Genders Day, it has been running for more than a decade!
